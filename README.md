# multilanguage-Welcome-json
A [JSON](https://www.json.org/) object with the word "welcome" in many languages.

## Background
I wanted to be able to insert a welcome in a randomized language into my personal webpage. I didn't find what I needed, so I created it. It can be used in any HTML form (or anywhere you use JSON).

## Data Sources
All translations are from [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/). I typed "welcome" into the left box, selected English as the source langage, and took the given result from each of the languages that Google provides.

## Languages
There are "welcome" values for all of the languages which [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) provides. All "language" values are in English. Make a Pull Request ("PR") if you would like to contribute additional multilingual support.

## Contribute!
Again, all of the "welcome" values use English as the source language and come from [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/). If you find a mistake, or if you would like to improve the translation, or if you have an idea for improving this repo, you are welcome to make a PR.
